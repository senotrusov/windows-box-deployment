# Contribution guidelines

## Code signing

Contributors are encouraged to sign their work, such as Git commits and tags. This practice verifies authenticity and protects the project's integrity. GPG keys are the recommended signing method, and signatures using SSH keys or other methods are also accepted.

## Contributor recognition

Contributors are warmly invited  to add their names to the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file, whether contributing through code, documentation, testing, or community support.

## Identity Policy

This project respects a contributor's right to choose the identity under which they make contributions. Contributors are not required to use their legal name, birth name, or a name from an official identification document. However, the chosen identity — whether a username, pseudonym, or real name — must be used consistently within the community to represent the contributor.

To maintain the integrity and trust of the project, the following principles apply:

- **No anonymity or misrepresentation:** While a chosen identity may be used, truly anonymous contributions are not permitted. A contributor's identity must not be false, misleading, or intended to misrepresent authorship.

- **Authorship continuity:** A contributor's identity should allow the community to recognize and attribute their contributions. Maintaining consistent authorship upholds trust, accountability, and the long-term integrity of the project.

- **Intellectual property and legal compliance:** Contributors must not use their chosen identity to conceal unlawful actions, misappropriate intellectual property, or evade legal or contractual obligations. Any such misuse undermines the project's integrity, the rights of all contributors, and harms those who contribute in good faith under a chosen identity.

- **Communication and accountability:** Each contributor must provide a valid email address and remain reachable for project-related matters. In the event of a legal dispute, contributors are expected to assist in establishing the provenance of their contribution.

Non-compliance with this policy may result in removal of contributions, suspension from the project, or other actions deemed necessary by project maintainers.

By submitting a contribution, the contributor affirms their understanding of and adherence to this policy.

## The use of the Developer's Certificate of Origin

This project's application of the Developer's Certificate of Origin aligns with established open-source practice.

A sign-off is a statement appended to the end of a commit message, certifying that a contributor is the original author of the contributed work or has the legal authority to submit it under the applicable open-source license. The process is as follows: if a contributor can make the following certification —

```plaintext
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

— then the contributor must include the following line in the commit message:

```plaintext
Signed-off-by: Contributor Identity <email@example.com>
```

using a recognized identity that can be attributed to the contributor within the context of the project.
